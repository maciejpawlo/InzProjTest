# InzProjTest
Non-invasive assessment of embolization in HVAD blood pump - acoustic signal processing mobile application

# General info 
This project was created as engineering thesis project. Its purpose is to detect anomalies in work of HVAD blood pump by analyzing acoustic signal produced by the pump itself.
Application is capable of recording audio (f.e. using external microphone connected with minijack input) and analyzing pre-recorded .wav file in order to find possible abnormalities
in produced audio (which can indicate a pump thrombosis).
